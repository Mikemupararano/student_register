# Student_register
## Description
This program allows a user to register students for an exam venue.
● First, the user is asked how many students are registering.
● A for loop runs for that number of students.
● Each time the loop runs the program asks the user to enter the
next student ID number.
● The program will write each of the ID numbers to a text file called reg_form.txt.
● A dotted line is included to the printout after each student ID because this document can be used as an attendance register, which the students will sign when they arrive at the exam venue.
